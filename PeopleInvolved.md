At the Office of Graduate Studies (OGS), my primary contacts are Vicki
Hudgins and Sharon Matson. I am planning on talking to Dr. Allada, but
have not met with him yet.


Dr Allada and Dr Newkirk are the people to meet with prior to presenting plans to the Graduate Faculty Council.


Professors who have worked on developing Latex .sty files, all
independent of one another:
  * Dr Tauritz, Computer Science
  * Dr Homan, Mechanical Engineering
  * Dr Gosavi, Engineering Management
  * Dr Vojta, Dr Yamilov; Physics
  * Dr Sarangapani, Elec. Comp. Engr
  * someone in the math department. Not sure who yet. [If anyone knows
who I should be working with, please email me.]


Another group of stakeholders is the library staff.  I have been
working with Roger Weaver (copyright issues), and will be meeting with
Becky Merrell (binding) on Friday.
